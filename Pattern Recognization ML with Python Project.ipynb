    "#### The Divergent Roles of Decision Trees in Classification and Regression\n",
    "Decision trees serve different purposes in classification and regression tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification:\n",
    "Used to predict the category or class of a data point.\n",
    "Splits data based on features, creating decision rules in a tree structure.\n",
    "Leaf nodes represent class labels.\n",
    "Output: Discrete class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression:\n",
    "Used to predict continuous numeric values.\n",
    "Splits data to minimize variance in predicted values.\n",
    "Leaf nodes contain numeric predictions.\n",
    "Output: Continuous numeric predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "Output Type: Classification trees produce discrete class labels, while regression trees provide continuous numeric predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Classification divides data into classes, regression predicts numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaf Values: Classification tree leaves hold class labels; regression tree leaves contain numeric predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation: Classification uses metrics like Gini impurity, regression uses MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Classification tree classifies emails as \"Spam\" or \"Not Spam,\" regression tree predicts house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, decision trees adapt to either task but vary in structure and output to suit specific needs."

    "\n",
    "A decision tree uses a sequence of feature comparisons and binary decisions to guide the traversal of the tree until it reaches a leaf node, which provides the prediction for the new data point. This prediction process is intuitive and interpretable, as each step corresponds to a decision based on a feature's value. Decision trees are versatile and widely used in machine learning due to their transparency and ability to capture complex decision-making processes."

    "SVMs optimize the \"Margin,\" which is the distance between the decision boundary and the nearest data points from each class. The objective is to find the hyperplane that maximizes this margin while accurately classifying the training data. This margin maximization criterion ensures robust decision boundaries for effective classification."

    "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) excel in classifying data but are initially designed for linearly separable data. In real-world scenarios where data isn't linearly separable, SVMs utilize the \"kernel trick\" to transform data into a higher-dimensional space, enhancing separability. \n",
